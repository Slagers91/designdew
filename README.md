## ‚ö°Ô∏è Snelle start

First of all, [download](https://golang.org/dl/) and install **Go**. Version `1.16` or higher is required.

Installation is done by using the [`go install`](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Compile_and_install_packages_and_dependencies) command and rename installed binary in `$GOPATH/bin`:

```bash
go install github.com/create-go-app/cli/v2/cmd/cgapp
```

Also, macOS and GNU/Linux users available way to install via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
# Tap a new formula:
brew tap create-go-app/cli

# Installation:
brew install create-go-app/cli/cgapp
```

Let's create a new project via **interactive console UI** (or **CUI** for short) in current folder:

```bash
cgapp create
```

Next, open the generated Ansible inventory file (called `hosts.ini`) and fill in the variables according to your server configuration. And you're ready to **automatically deploy** this project:

```bash
cgapp deploy
```

That's all you need to know to start! üéâ
